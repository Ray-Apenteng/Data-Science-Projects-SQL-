# Analyzing Layoffs During the COVID-19 Era: A Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis Project on Company Layoffs from March 2020 to March 2023


### Project Description:
**Analyzing Layoffs During the COVID-19 Era**: *A Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis Project on Company Layoffs from March 2020 to March 2023*

The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly impacted the global economy, leading to significant layoffs across various industries. This project analyzes layoff data from different companies between March 2020 and March 2023. The primary objectives are to clean the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, and to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to these layoffs.

### Objectives:

	1. #### Data Cleaning:
	- Identify and handle missing, duplicate, or inconsistent data.
	- Standardize data formats for dates, company names, and other relevant fields.
	- Validate the accuracy of the layoff records.
	2. #### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
	- Analyze the distribution and frequency of layoffs over the specified period.
	- Identify the most affected industries and regions.
	- Examine the relationship between layoffs and other factors such as company size, industry type, and geographic location.

### Key Activities:
- Data Collection: Gather layoff data from reliable sources for the specified period.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for analysis.
- Descriptive Statistics: Calculate key statistics to summarize the data.
- Insights Generation: Interpret the results to draw meaningful conclusions about the layoff trends during the COVID-19 era.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **SQL**: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and querying.

### Expected Outcomes:
- A clean and well-organized dataset on layoffs between March 2020 and March 2023.
- Key Information that highlights key trends and patterns in the layoff data.
- Insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employment across various industries and regions.

This project will provide valuable insights into how the pandemic affected different industries and regions.
